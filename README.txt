This is a project developed for a company I worked for, where it completely automated the badge production process, from selecting each person's data, editing photos and even separating them by state for sending. Fully automatically.
A process that previously took hours to complete now takes just a few minutes.

Technologies used: 
- Python (Pandas, OpenPyXL, RegularExpressions, Requests, PIL, Path, Datetime, shutil, BeautifulSoup, os, PyAutoGUI, Pyperclip. )
- SQL
